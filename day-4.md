# Rapid content creation is draining to me


Something I have realized fairly quickly with this 30 day challenge is that while I do enjoy going deep on topics I am not very fast at synthesizing that information quickly. Trying to post helpful somewhat long for content daily is giving me anxiety. I either look to reduce the length or reduce the output.

Being an INFJ and taking time to understand what my personality type is all about I have realized that I need to focus on quality no quantity. That gives me more fulfillment. 

Personally I am glad I have undertaken this because it is helping me rapidly sample topics and techniques. Getting ever closer to knowing what I actually enjoy.
