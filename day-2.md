### Tailoring IT products and services to meet customer requirements

For us to understand the evolution of technology expereicens we need to look back on the experiences we had in the 90s and early 2000s. This references will for one give you some appreciation of how far we have come and two, how consumer technology has significantly outpaced the technology provided to employees in the workplace. Therefore, impacting preferences and expectations for the work experiences people expect. This phenomenon, has been often referred to as the "consumerization of IT," which can be attributed to several factors.

First, the rapid advancements in consumer technology have led to the development of user-friendly devices and applications, offering seamless experiences and intuitive interfaces. Smartphones, tablets, and various apps have become integral parts of people's daily lives, setting a high standard for user experience (UX) and ease of use. As a result, employees now expect similar levels of usability and convenience in their work-related tools and technologies. Can you even rememeber a world pre iPhone? It's hard to imagine now.

Second, the widespread adoption of cloud-based services and mobile applications has enabled users to access information and services on-demand, regardless of their location or the device they are using. This flexibility has raised expectations for workplace technology, with employees seeking tools that offer the same level of accessibility and collaboration capabilities. 

Third, the rise of social media platforms and real-time communication tools has influenced the way people communicate and collaborate. Employees now expect their workplace technology to facilitate instant communication, collaboration, and information sharing, similar to what they experience in their personal lives.

These factors have collectively shaped employee preferences and expectations for workplace technology, driving the demand for more user-centric IT solutions in the professional environment. Organizations must recognize and address these expectations to attract and retain top talent, boost productivity, and enhance employee satisfaction. of course this is easier said then done, but it this is an infinite game that must played iteratively. Do not merely adpat to the changing, challenging, and unpredicatable environment, overcompensate and embrace the concept of "antifragility" as presented in the book "Antifragile" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb. Antifragility is a quality that enables systems to not only withstand shocks, uncertainties, and volatility but also to grow stronger and improve as a result of these challenges.
