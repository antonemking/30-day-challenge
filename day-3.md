# FDIC, the hero SVB didn't deserve


I felt the urge to do some research on FDIC after the collapose of SVB. It made me wonder who pays for the insurance, who set the limit to 250k, and how many time has it been used to protect depositors.


## Intro 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was created in 1933 as part of the Banking Act, which was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The establishment of the FDIC was a response to the widespread bank failures and loss of public confidence in the banking system that occurred during the Great Depression.

From its establishment in 1933 through the end of 2020, the FDIC has been involved in more than 3,000 bank failures. The FDIC has been particularly active during periods of financial stress, such as the Savings and Loan crisis in the 1980s and the financial crisis of 2007-2009. Throughout its history, no depositor has lost any insured funds as a result of a bank failure, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the FDIC in providing a safety net for depositors and maintaining confidence in the U.S. banking system.


### I still don't get what the FDIC is, ELI5

FDIC insurance is like a safety net for your money when you put it in a bank. Imagine you have a piggy bank where you save all your money. One day, the piggy bank breaks, and all your money is gone. That would be very sad, right?

Now, think about the FDIC as a superhero that protects your piggy bank. If something happens to the bank where you keep your money, the superhero comes and saves your money, so you don't lose it. The superhero will protect the money you put in the bank, up to a certain amount, which means you can feel safe knowing your money is protected.

### The heros journey


Let me explain why I think the superhero analogy is perfect for FDIC. FDIC has a protection limit of 250k. This gives our superheor a theoretical known limit that sort of aligns to a real superhero. For example, Dragon Ball Z , most of the heros had known power limits. However, those limits can be exceeded with the right catalyst e.g. weird alien trying to kill everyone or Silicon Valley Bank contagion. 

In my opinion I don't compare this event to the financial crisis of 2008, this wasn't a bail out of the bank, the equity went to 0, all shareholders were wiped out. This was protection of the depositors cash, cash that is used to fund payroll for their employees and continue operations. Imagine the collateral damage that would ensue if the hero in our story didn't untap its full potential. We would have witnessed the extinction of alot of innovation and put the US at a disadvantage to our competition. Not only that but the lost trust in local credit unions and smaller banks. 

One shouldn‚Äôt have to be a forensic accountant before opening a checking account. Silly talk and if it was‚Ä¶ guess what, the only banks left would be JPM, Wells Fargo (EWW), and UBS maybe.


Remeber there is usally a trade off for unlocking that kind of power so I guess time will tell what is in-store in the next episode. Grab your üçø

Be blessed.
