# FDIC, the hero SVB didn't deserve


I felt the urge to do some research on FDIC after the collapose of SVB. It made me wonder who pays for the insurance, who set the limit to 250k, and how many time has it been used to protecy depositors

TODO

-[ ] Who pays and why 250k
 
-[ ] Add case studies of when FDIC was used

### What is FDIC ELI5

FDIC insurance is like a safety net for your money when you put it in a bank. Imagine you have a piggy bank where you save all your money. One day, the piggy bank breaks, and all your money is gone. That would be very sad, right?

Now, think about the FDIC as a superhero that protects your piggy bank. If something happens to the bank where you keep your money, the superhero comes and saves your money, so you don't lose it. The superhero will protect the money you put in the bank, up to a certain amount, which means you can feel safe knowing your money is protected.

### The heros journey


Let me explain why I think the superhero analogy is perfect for FDIC. FDIC has a protection limit of 250k. This gives our superheor a theoretical known limit that sort of aligns to a real superhero. Dragonball Z for example, alot of the heros had known power limits they could reach. However, we all know those limits can get exceeded with the right catalyst e.g. weird alien tryting to kill everyone or Silicon Valley Bank collapse. 

Now the resurgance of our hero didn't happen immmeadiately because he had to train, get beat up a bit and then when we least expect it the unbeatable villan gets outmatched by our hero. I don't compare this event to 2008, this wasn't a bail out of the bank, the equity went to 0. This was the protection the depositors with cash there. This cash is used to fund payroll for employees and continue operations. The immense contagion that would ensue if the hero in our story didn't untap its full potential would have led to an extinction of alot of innovation and put the US at a disadvantage to our competitors.

That is my view but I do realize that just like in the movies there is usally a trade off for unlocking that kind of power so I guess time will tell what is in store in the next episode. Grab your üçø

Be blessed.
