As the leader of a learning organization, I recognize the importance of fostering an environment that promotes continuous growth, self-improvement, and adaptability. Embracing the principles of personal mastery and effective time management, I am committed to implementing a holistic approach that addresses individual needs and leverages the unique strengths of each team member. For myself I will be focusing specifically on personal mastery and time management. Having ADHD, I often struggle with maintaining focus, and I tend to become bored easily. This has led me to explore different technical areas in search of constant stimulation. While this curiosity has broadened my knowledge, it has also made it difficult for me to commit to a single topic and truly master it. I believe that by concentrating on personal mastery and time management, I can ultimately excel in my chosen field.
